                <p class="firstLetter">Happiness! What do you mean by happiness? Some of you might mean that if I have a big bungalow, have 2-3 cars, pretty life partner, etc. or students might think that if I get good result, I will have a blissful and happy life. But is it the real meaning of happiness? No. This is our general misconception that those things make us happy. In real way, the happiness is broader concept and it is within ourselves.</p>
			
                <p>As <a href="https://isha.sadhguru.org/" target="_blank">Sadhguru</a> says happiness is basic requirement of our lives, it should not be goal of our life. We, human beings, are always focus on in terms of materialistic objects to be happy. Of course, those things make us happy or satisfied but that happiness or satisfaction is temporary, it does not matter in our real happiness. <a href="https://psychology.yale.edu/people/laurie-santos" target="_blank">Dr. Laurie Santos</a>, Professor at Yale University, has described what is real happiness? why do we run behind those things which do not matter in our happiness? etc. in her course <cite>The Science of Well-Being</cite> and also in her podcast <cite><a href="https://www.happinesslab.fm/">Happiness Lab</a></cite>. She has described researches done by some fellows regarding happiness. She described that it is annoying features of mind that we run behind temporary happiness. We think in terms of future likeness of those things or we make some reference point to decide our happiness level like neighbor or friend, as well we don't realize that our minds are getting used to those stuffs. That means if we get expected marks or more than expected or even less than expected marks, we are going to be used to it and will not deviate our actual happiness level. So, our prediction is wrong that more marks make us happier. So, what can we do? Can we achieve happiness? Yes, we should change our reference point as well invest our time and money in those things which makes actually happier. Like, research shows that the time or money spent into new experiences, e.g. camping, give more happiness than spent in buying new stuffs. Also spending money for someone make us happier than spending for us. As well exercise, meditation, kindness, enough sleep, having gratitude, good social connection, doing works (our strength), having growth mindset boost our happiness level. So, we have to make habit of those processes to be happy and also make happy.</p>
                
                <p>So, we should <em>invest</em> our time to those things that makes us actually happy rather running behind those things that brings temporary happiness.</p>
